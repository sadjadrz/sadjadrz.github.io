Hello and welcome!!

My name is Sadjad Rezvani and I am a recent graduate of the Master of Science in computer engineering - artificial intelligence program at [Shahrood University of Technology](https://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/) in Iran. I am excited to take my academic journey to the next level by pursuing a PhD.

Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have developed a strong background in computer vision and software engineering. As a Senior Computer Vision Software Engineer at [Shahaab, CO](https://shahaab-co.com/en/), I have contributed to various projects, including designing and implementing features for a plate recognition, face recognition engine and a salt crack sorting machine. I am also passionate about teaching and have served as a Teaching Assistant for Deep Learning and Database courses. 

Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal site, and I invite you to explore my CV and research interests further.
